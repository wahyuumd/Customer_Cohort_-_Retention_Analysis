# Customer Cohort & Retention Analysis

This project focuses on cohort analysis to understand and enhance customer retention in a retail context. Cohort analysis is a behavioral analytics technique that groups users based on shared characteristics to analyze usage patterns and behavior. By examining these patterns, companies can gain insights into customer actions and retention trends over time.

The customer retention rate is a critical metric, as it measures the percentage of customers who continue to engage with a business within a given period. High retention indicates strong customer loyalty, which directly impacts long-term growth and revenue. Monthly retention rates provide insight into customer engagement, allowing companies to evaluate campaign effectiveness, understand transaction patterns, and implement timely strategies to increase loyalty and minimize churn.

### Project Goals

Using descriptive statistics, this project will analyze monthly customer retention rates. By calculating monthly retention, the analysis aims to:

- Reveal patterns in customer behavior
- Evaluate campaign effectiveness
- Identify opportunities to improve customer loyalty
